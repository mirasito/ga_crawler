# State: GA Crawler

**Last updated:** 2026-05-05
**Mode:** Initialized — ready for Phase 1 planning

## Project Reference

**Core value:** Команда viled.kz один раз в неделю получает детализированный, сопоставленный по позициям отчёт о ценах конкурента (goldapple.kz) и может корректировать собственное ценообразование, видеть ассортиментные разрывы и отслеживать чужие промо-акции.

**Current focus:** Pre-flight — roadmap defined, awaiting Phase 1 plan.

## Current Position

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Phase | 1 — Goldapple Reconnaissance Spike |
| Plan | (none yet — run `/gsd-plan-phase 1`) |
| Status | Not started |
| Progress | `[░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 0/7 phases` |
| Branch strategy | none (single-trunk) |

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Phases planned | 7 |
| Phases completed | 0 |
| v1 requirements mapped | 48/48 |
| Plans completed | 0 |
| Spawned agents (this session) | roadmapper |
| Checkpoints | 0 |

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Source | Constraint Imposed |
|----------|--------|--------------------|
| Strict-key matching only on v1 (`brand_norm + name_norm + volume_norm`) | PROJECT.md | Forces brand-alias YAML as v1 deliverable in Phase 2; defers fuzzy matching to v2 |
| Append-only snapshot history keyed by `run_id` | research/ARCHITECTURE.md | No in-place updates; Phase 2 schema is final from week 1 |
| `was_price` and stock-state enum captured in v1 schema | research/SUMMARY.md | Avoids retroactive backfill; prevents v1.x re-crawl |
| Match-rate as a tracked KPI from week 1 | research/SUMMARY.md | Phase 4 must log/store match-rate to establish historical baseline |
| Reporter is independent of delivery (file on disk first, Telegram wraps it) | research/ARCHITECTURE.md | Phase 5 produces archive without Telegram; Phase 6 is a thin wrapper |
| Two Telegram chats (ops vs business) | research/PITFALLS.md | Pre-send sanity-gate (Phase 4 + Phase 6) prevents broken reports reaching pricing team |
| Goldapple anti-bot tier decided empirically before any production code | research/SUMMARY.md | Phase 1 is throwaway spike; Phase 3 stack waits on its decision memo |
| SQLite + WAL on v1; Postgres only if SQLite hits limits | research/STACK.md | Single-writer batch fit; defers infra complexity |
| System cron with `CRON_TZ=Asia/Almaty`; no APScheduler/Celery/Prefect | research/STACK.md | Phase 7 minimum; one weekly job |
| Backend-only — no UI / dashboard / API | PROJECT.md (Out of Scope) | All phases `UI hint: no` |

### Active Todos

(none — awaiting Phase 1 plan)

### Active Blockers

(none)

## Session Continuity

### What Was Just Done

- Read PROJECT.md and REQUIREMENTS.md
- Read research/SUMMARY.md, STACK.md, FEATURES.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, PITFALLS.md
- Derived 7-phase roadmap aligned with research synthesis (Phase 1 spike, viled-first build, goldapple-second, matcher, reporter, delivery, scheduler)
- Mapped all 48 enumerated v1 requirements to phases (no orphans, no duplicates)
- Wrote ROADMAP.md with phase details and success criteria
- Updated REQUIREMENTS.md traceability section

### What's Next

1. `/gsd-plan-phase 1` — generate the executable plan for the Goldapple Reconnaissance Spike (timeboxed, throwaway).
2. Spike outcome (decision memo) feeds Phase 3 stack selection.

### Resume Instructions

To continue this project from a fresh session:
1. Read `.planning/PROJECT.md` for core value and constraints.
2. Read `.planning/ROADMAP.md` for phase structure.
3. Read this STATE.md for current position.
4. Run `/gsd-plan-phase 1` to begin Phase 1.
